## 💭 Why I Built This

I got tired of seeing beginners struggle with overly complex DevOps tutorials. Most guides assume you already know Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and a dozen other tools. 

This toolkit strips away the complexity and gives you just what you need to get started. Once you're comfortable with these basics, you can graduate to more advanced tools.
